# API Design

This project is setup for the discussion of API design as well as the demostrations for the different approaches. The code is initially generated by the https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/, I'm also trying to explore the potential of how AI can assist engineers.

There are three popular approaches of API design currently including Rest API, gRPC, and Open API.

## Rest API

### Architectural Constraints
- Clientâ€“server architecture
- Statelessness
- Cacheability
- Layered system
- Code on demand (optional)
- Uniform interface
> refer to wikipedia(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Architectural_constraints) for more details

### Applied to web services
- a base URI, such as http://api.example.com/
- standard HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE)
- a media type that defines state transition data elements 

#### CRUD
- POST   --> CREATE *(non-idempotent)*
- GET    --> READ   *(idempotent)*
- PUT    --> UPDATE *(idempotent)*
- DELETE --> DELETE *(idempotent)*

#### Version
Versioning allows an implementation to provide backward compatibility so that if we introduce breaking changes from one version to another, consumers get enough time to move to the next version.

There are many ways to version an API. The most straightforward is to prefix the version before the resource on the URI. For instance:

- https://shopee.com/v1/products
- https://shopee.com/v2/products

## gRPC

## Open API
